How to Use the Simulator
To run the simulator, first compile the source files. Then use the following command format:
./sim <input_file>
<input_file>: A text file containing the program (in assembly or machine code format) to be loaded into the simulatorâ€™s memory.
This will launch an interactive shell that allows you to control the execution of the simulated pipelined ARM processor.

Shell Commands
The simulator includes a command-line shell interface that supports several commands to inspect and control the simulation. Below is a list of all supported commands:
1. go
Simulate the program until it indicates that the simulator should halt (e.g., when a HALT instruction is encountered). This executes the entire program without stopping.
2. run <n>
Simulate the execution of the machine for <n> instructions. This is useful for step-by-step debugging or testing specific sections of code.
3. mdump <low> <high>
Dump the contents of memory from address <low> to <high>. The output is printed to the screen and also saved in the file dumpsim.
4. rdump
Dump the current state of the processor to the screen and to the file dumpsim. This includes:
Instruction count
Register values (X0 to X31)
Condition flags (N and Z)
Program counter (PC)
5. input <reg_num> <reg_val>
Set the general-purpose register number <reg_num> to the value <reg_val>. This is useful for initializing registers before execution.
6. ?
Print a list of all supported shell commands.
7. quit
Exit the shell and terminate the simulation.

Output
All output generated by mdump and rdump commands is written to a file named dumpsim in the current working directory. This allows for easy inspection and logging of simulation state.
